          <h2>My Photography</h2>
          <p class="project-description">
            These photos are from a photoshoot i did when i was in grade school. 
            My concept with the photoshoot was to capture the beauty of nature from different angles. 
            I was very pleased with the outcome at the time, but today i would probably do a lot of things differently.<br>
            The feautured models are Wilma and Moa, in that order.

          <h2>Infographic About My Life</h2>
          <p class="project-description">
           This project is very important to me for its meaning.
           This represents all the rooms I´ve had throughout my childhood to the present. 
           I decided to make a infographic using isometric design, which was pretty hard, seeing as I´ve never used it before.

          <h2>App Design: Thriftme</h2>
          <p class="project-description">
            This project was based on a brief about how to use digital tools to help upcycle and reuse things that otherwise 
            would be thrown out. My solution was an app inspired by Tinder, but you swap clothes with eachother to help combat
            the high consumerism of today.
